SOEN 6611 (Software Measurement)

**COURSE OBJECTIVES:**

Theoretical aspect:<br>
Using metrics for managing software development, software size and complexity metrics (LOC, McCabe), 
object-oriented software metrics (C&K, and QMOOD), metrics in quality assurance activities, 
mining software repositories, as well as frameworks and methods for the theoretical and empirical 
validation of software metrics.

Practical aspect:<br>
Collection of metrics from software systems. In context of the project, perform analytics on software 
metrics by collecting metrics from Open-Source Systems and conducting empirical studies.








**REQUIREMENTS:**

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.5
- Understand by Scitools : for metrics collection
