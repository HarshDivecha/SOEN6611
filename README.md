SOEN 6611 (Software Measurement)

**COURSE OBJECTIVES:**

Theoretical aspect:<br>
Using metrics for managing software development, software size and complexity metrics (LOC, McCabe), 
object-oriented software metrics (C&K, and QMOOD), metrics in quality assurance activities, 
mining software repositories, as well as frameworks and methods for the theoretical and empirical 
validation of software metrics.

Practical aspect:<br>
Collection of metrics from software systems. In context of the project, perform analytics on software 
metrics by collecting metrics from Open-Source Systems and conducting empirical studies.

**Folder Contents:**
- Html analysis notebooks : Contains the analysis notebooks in .html format
- data : Contains data for analysis.
- plots : Contains auto generated project folders and their respective plots.
- docs : All the documents refered and created for project.
- archive : All the previous work.

**Notes:**
- Data reading and cleaning functions are customly written.
- These functions have been separated into a different file "functions.py"

**REQUIREMENTS:**
